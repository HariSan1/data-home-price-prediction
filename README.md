data-home-price-prediction
Python and tensor flow code to adapt home price predictions from Kaggle
simple-classifier-1.py - extremely simple decision tree prediction python file to get started
house_train_model_kaggle_data.py - Use housing price dataset from kaggle (Kings County, Washington state, USA) to predict house price 
- read csv file, create dataframe, drop unused fields (columns), then use Gradient Regression to train and predict	
house_train_model_tensorflow.py - same as above,but use Google's tensorflow app
- note: To use this, Tensorflow needs to be installed and working...get it from here - https://www.tensorflow.org/
- read notes for Tensorflow, installation can be sometimes tricky
kc_house_data.csv - data file for above python code with historical pricing data for Kings County, Washington state, USA) from Kaggle
